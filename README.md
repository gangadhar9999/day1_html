🌟 Day 1 – My First HTML Webpage
This is my very first webpage built while learning HTML basics.
It demonstrates the fundamental structure of an HTML document along with commonly used tags.

📌 Features Implemented
✅ Basic HTML document structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)
✅ A heading (<h1>) and a descriptive paragraph (<p>)
✅ An image with src, alt, and width attributes
✅ A clickable link (<a>) that opens in a new tab
✅ An ordered list (<ol>) to list learning goals
✅ An unordered list (<ul>) to list favorite fruits

🏗️ HTML Concepts Practiced

Text content elements: headings, paragraphs

Adding images and links

Creating lists (ordered and unordered)

Attributes like target="_blank", alt, width
